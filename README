REQUIREMENTS
============

The following packages are required in order to build and use the project files:

* cmake

* an opencl sdk
* an opencl library
* an icd loader (might be included in the opencl library)

There are several providers for this triplet, nvidia, amd and optionnaly intel.
Nvidia opencl library only support Nvidia hardware. It is likely to be package
for your distribution because the licence permits it.
AMD's has support for both AMD graphic cards and any sse3 compatible processor.
You should choose this if you don't have an Nvidia graphic card.
Note that AMD license prevents most linux distribution to package it in the
repositories.
POCL looks promising, at least for developpement and testing.
Intel sdk for Opencl not available on linux.

BUILDING
========

In order to build, you need to create a build directory:

 mkdir build
 cd build

generate makefiles with cmake:

  cmake (path to the project root dir)
  # if build is inside the project:
  cmake ../

then make any target, for example:
  make test_cl

  you can execute it:
  ./tests/test_cl

TARGETS
=======

* test_cl (tests/test_cl)
  It is a quick and simple OpenCL HelloWorld program.
  Use it to test your OpenCL environment.
