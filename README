REQUIREMENTS
============

The following packages are required in order to build and use the project files:

* cmake
* pkg-config (if you choose POCL as OpenCL implementation)

* an opencl sdk
* an opencl library
* an icd loader (might be included in the opencl library)

There are several providers for this triplet, nvidia, amd and optionnaly intel.
* Nvidia opencl library only support Nvidia hardware. It is likely to be package
  for your distribution because the licence permits it.
* AMD's has support for both AMD graphic cards and any sse3 compatible processor.
  You should choose this if you don't have an Nvidia graphic card.
  Note that AMD license prevents most linux distribution to package it in the
  repositories.
* POCL is simpler, *ideal for developpement and testing*.
* Intel sdk for OpenCL not available on linux.

TEST ENVIRONMENT
================

In the tests directory, there is a small hello world program, you can use it in
order to check if your openCL environement is correct

	cd tests

if you use POCL:

	g++ test_cl.cpp `pkg-config pocl --libs --cflags` -o helloWorld

if you use another librarie (adjust include paths if necessary):
	
	g++ test_cl.cpp -lOpenCL -o helloWorld -std=c++11

then execute with:

	./helloWorld



BUILDING
========

In order to build the project, you need to create a build directory:

 mkdir build
 cd build

generate makefiles with cmake:

  cmake (path to the project root dir)

if you use a build directory at the root of the project and use POCL
statically (without icd loader support), you may type:

  cmake ../ -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wunreachable-code"

then build everything:

  make 

and run the tests:

  make test
