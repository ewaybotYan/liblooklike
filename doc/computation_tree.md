Computation tree    {#computation_tree}
================



    Example:
    in a = b + c <br/>
    a, b and c are all algorithms. It can also be
    represented as a tree where a is the root node,
    and has two children b and c.
    In order to compute a, we will execute evaluate().
    And then retrieve data from the computation device with
    retrieveData()

As shown in the example above, the expression is represented as
a tree. The terminal nodes are basically values known by the
program on the computer side, whereas the other nodes are values
obtained by computation on their children nodes.
