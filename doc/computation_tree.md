Computation tree    {#computation_tree}
================

This programs manipulates mathematical values and performs computation on them.
Everything that has a value, either a known value or the result of a
computation will be called an expression. An expression can be a matrix, a
scalar value... The operations that perform computations are reprouped in a
generic object that we call an algorithm. An addition is an algorithms that
takes two expressions in input and yeld one result which is also an expression.
