Liblooklike documentation
=========================

This is the documentation of the liblooklike project.
Liblooklike aims to provide a generic computation plateform. One of the main
features is the integration of OpenCL in the environment which simplifies the
process of wrinting parallel algorithms.
Liblooklike uses this platform to perform data analysis computation for face 
recognition.
