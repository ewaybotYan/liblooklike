Liblooklike documentation
=========================

This is the technical documentation of the liblooklike project.
Liblooklike aims to provide an generic computation plateform. One of the main
features is the integration of OpenCL in the environment which simplifies the
process of wrinting parallel algorithms.

Quick links
-----------

While this documentation only focuses on the project code, here are a few
external links that might be useful:

- Project page on github, also includes the installation procedure: https://github.com/pixelou/liblooklike
- Online version of this documentation: http://pixelou.github.io/liblooklike/html/index.html
- Project context (with an introduction to OpenCL): to come later

General aspects
---------------

The following pages explain the main concepts used in the project and might be
necessary to understand the global architecture:
- @ref computation_tree
- @ref expression
- @ref algorithm
- @ref tree_evaluation

Tutorials
---------

An example is often worth a lot of words, the @ref tutorials page provides a
comprehensive introduction to the project both for users and developers.
